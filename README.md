## Pros and Cons of TDD


### Pros of TDD:
* TDD forces code to be modular, and thus changes to be modular.
* TDD also encourages modular build up of applications, and therefore strong application architecture.
* Unit tests can form as documentation for code changes, or progress in a project as tests are added as functionality is added.
* TDD makes code easy to maintain and increases clarity during the implementation process.
* TDD makes collaboration more efficient, "team members can edit each others code with confidence because the tests will inform them if the changes are making the code behave in unexpected ways."
* Unit tests can help clarify requirements: unit tests require a specific output for a specific scenario, and this process can help to determine and even modularize project requirements.

### Cons of TDD:
* TDD tests not be able to completely test all functionality of an application.
* TDD tests can be time consuming and even difficult to write. For this reason, TDD can initially slow down development (although in the long run, TDD will speed up development).
* TDD is challenging to learn. TDD can be done, and it can be done well. If tests are too basic and not comprehensive enough their effects are not optimized, and time is still wasted writing test cases.
* TDD is a constant and iterative process (and therefore time consuming), sometimes failing test units will lead into needed code changes, and more test unites and so on and so forth.
* TDD, because it is repetitive can be tedious.
* If tests aren't properly maintained with new code developments amongst team members, then the whole efficacy of TDD test units is diminished.
